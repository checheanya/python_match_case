# :sparkles:  Match-case statement in Python :sparkles:

Here we discuss the main features and usage of the **match-case statement**, introduced in *Python 3.10*.  <br>
First of all, in order to run all scripts and explore the power of match-case statement, you have to install Python>=3.10. You can download Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

The main conspect with example codes showcasing main options is in the `Match_case.ipynb` notebook, check it out if you want to get some insights on the match-case and ret rid of wordy `if-elif-elif-else` parts in your code! 

To download the notedook and example scripts run:

```bash
https://github.com/checheanya/python_match_case.git
cd python_match_case
```

Here we provide several examples of match-case in more or less big programs, that you might face:

### 1. **Calculator**   :triangular_ruler: 	:straight_ruler: 
This program implements simple calculator preforming different operations based on the user's choice. The calculator function takes an operation, two numbers, and uses the match case statement to determine which operation to perform. You can run the program by simply typing:

```python
python calculator.py
```
and then entering the options following the program instructions.

### 2. Bank account manager  :dollar:  :chart:

In this program you can play with different operations on bank accounts: you can create, delete accounts and transfer money to/from existing accounts. You can run the program by executing:

```python
python bank_account.py
```
Just follow the instructions on the screen and have fun while match-case is doing its work under the hood. <br>
Chech out the code of the `bank_account.py` to see what's goin on there. 

### 2. Nucleic acids operations :dna: 

In this small script we implemented basic operation with DNA and RNA using match-case statement for choosing the right functions to perform. You can edit script calls after example comment and see how match-case handles different combinations of elements given.
To run the default example, simply run:

```python
python nucleic_acids.py
```
